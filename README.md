Susan reviewed my Figma and liked that I kept the colors the same of the company I chose. Pink and orange are signature colors for Dunkin and I didn’t think changing those would adequately portray the company’s brand. For the most part, the layout of the original design was good it was just that I thought they should focus more on their products than on their perk reward program.

Some of the other changes made to my Figma this week are: 
Susan recommended a way to show the DDPerks at the top was a link to another page. This would be easier to add code and make it either underline or enlarge when hovering the mouse over it. To bring attention in my static design, I decided to underline both the Dunkin and DDPerks text at the top. 
Susan also recommended adding a slight background change between the sections of the layout grid. I added a slight change in color in two different sections on the layout grid but only one of them stands out. 

After adding the changes, I decided to add some effects to some of the larger text. I added a drop shadow to add some effect against the flat design. I liked the look of the Inner shadow when viewing from Figma but after posting to github noticed the colors looked darker (the white looked more of a gray)—but like the 3D effect it added. I changed it back to just the drop shadow because I didn’t want it dulling my colors, I wanted to the pink, orange, and white text to pop.
